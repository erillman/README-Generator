# README File Generator/Organizer


## Description:
This program will help you create simple README files in the directory it is placed in and rename existing README files to a randomized 6-lettered lowercase string(storing it in the same directory).

## Why would I want to use this?
You might be someone who pushes code consistently to github and you would like some assistance creating README files. Not only this, but you might be someone who also wants to keep old README files just for the sake of looking back on some files. Otherwise, this was just a project I made for fun so enjoy!

## How to use:
In order to use this program, you must store it in a directory of your choice. I personally keep it a few levels down from my desktop but you can do whatever. Make sure to change the "save_path" and "new_path" variables to the directory PATH where you save this code. Now you are good to go and just run it!
